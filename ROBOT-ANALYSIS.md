User-agent: *  
Crawl-delay: 10  
Allow: /  

User-agent: SemrushBot  
Disallow: /  

  
## Explanation  

There are two rules thedp cares about. The first one applies to all bots as User-agent is set to *, meaning all.  
This rule sets Crawl-delay to 10 seconds, meaning bots should wait 10 minutes between requests. It also allows bots on the whole site, as signified by the Allow: /  

The second rule targets specifically SemrushBot. It disallows Semrushbot from accessing the whole site.
